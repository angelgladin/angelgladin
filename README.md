## Hi there 👋

My name is `Ángel Gladín`, I'm a programmer with experience in Android Development and System Design. Also, been doing a little bit of back-end. Love learning and applying Algorithms \& Data Structures.


I love teaching (especially) science to people, no matter what their background is. As Richard Feynmann said,

> If you can't explain an idea to an 8-year-old, you don't understand it.

- Experienced: [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack), [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) ecosystem.
- Interested in: Functional Programming, Data Engineering, Data Science.

## About me (not technical stuff)

Besides of that, I love animals and nature.
